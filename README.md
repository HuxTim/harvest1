## Demo
Here is a live demo deployed on heroku with fake data :  https://harvest-farmermarket.herokuapp.com/

## Notes
In  order to run the search function on the localhost, one must run the command in the terminal

```
- rake sunspot:solr:start
```
Data is also aleeady seeded. This can be redone with

```
- rake db:seed
```

The site is hosted on harvest-farmermarket.herokuapp.com. The search function is not accessible through there as deploying the solr gem on heroku costs fifteen dollars a month

## DataBase Schema

- After coming up with several example user stories, we set upon building the models for our different users, their relationships and functionalities. The database is broken down into all those entities. We use a standard schema, so all tables have IDs and based off their relationships, they have foreign keys. Figure 2 shows the database schema.

- After creating an account, a new tuple is created in the Users table. The only geographical data we ask for is zip code, which is enough for finding local farmers markets. The only points where we ask for specific geographic data is within the Markets table. Store location can be implied through the market they conduct business at. This is modeled through a Store-Markets table. That table is linked to the Requests table, which is used for linking a vendor's request for his store to appear on the market's store directory.

- Users request to become vendors through their profile page. From there, they can start their own store. At the time of creation, vendors must enter their open and close time, which must exist within the limits of the hours of any markets they sell things at. Market owners then must go to their own profiles to accept any requests to join their market page. Because of the limited amounts of farmers markets in the United States, entry for a farmers market to our site's database must be manually done.

- Different user functionalities are all contained within the site's database model. Reviews for stores and markets are separated into two tables, both have fields containing the review, the user, and the entity. Separating the two was a design choice to improve retrieval speeds and to ease coding as a singular table holding both reviews would need an additional field for differentiating the two. Subscriptions and the Shopping list is simply a table holding the IDs of the respective entities. 
In the case of our image storage, the database models interfaces with the ruby gem, paperclip. The table's field is then configured for the gem's validations and support image resizing.

## To-Do
- Improve search algorithm 
- Make a more robust search algorithm for more complex searches. Attain faster search speeds by indexing products against markets for better distance related searches.
- Expand Functionality
- Possibly create an algorithm that suggest products, vendors, or markets based on location, preference, and shopping list.
